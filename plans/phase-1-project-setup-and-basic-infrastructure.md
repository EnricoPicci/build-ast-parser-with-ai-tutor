# Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure

## Overview
This phase focuses exclusively on setting up the foundational TypeScript project infrastructure without any COBOL-specific parsing logic. The goal is to establish a solid development environment and basic CLI framework.

## Tasks
1. Initialize TypeScript Node.js project with package.json
2. Set up development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Jest for testing)
3. Create basic project directory structure
4. Implement CLI argument handling for file path input
5. Create basic file I/O operations for reading COBOL files
6. Set up basic error handling and logging framework
7. Create entry point (index.ts) with command-line interface
8. Set up build and development scripts

## Deliverables
- Complete TypeScript project setup with proper configuration
- Working CLI that accepts COBOL file path as argument
- Basic file reading capabilities with error handling
- Project structure with organized directories (src/, tests/, etc.)
- Development tooling configured and working
- Basic unit test framework established

## Technical Requirements
- TypeScript configuration with appropriate target and module settings
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Jest for unit testing
- Package.json with proper scripts for build, test, and development
- Basic CLI argument validation
- File existence and readability checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- CLI application can be invoked with a file path argument
- Application can read a COBOL file and report success/failure
- All development tools work correctly
- Project structure follows TypeScript best practices
- Basic error handling for missing files or invalid arguments

## Duration
2-3 days

## Dependencies
None - this is the foundation phase

## Next Phase
Phase 2: Basic COBOL Line Processing will build upon this infrastructure to add COBOL-specific file handling capabilities.
