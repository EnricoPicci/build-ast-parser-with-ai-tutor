# QUESTION 1
Generate a diagram that shows the dependencies between folders in the `src` folder and its subfolders. A folder depends on another folder if any of its files imports files from that folder. The diagram should be in Mermaid format.

# Response 1
I'll analyze the dependencies between folders in the src directory by examining the imports in each file. Let me start by exploring the file structure and then reading the files to understand their dependencies. Now let me read all the TypeScript files to analyze their import statements and determine the dependencies between folders: Now let me read the parser files: Let me continue reading the parser files and utils files to get all the import dependencies: Now let me read the utils files: Now I have enough information to analyze the dependencies. Let me create a Mermaid diagram showing the folder dependencies based on the import statements I found: 

Made changes.

I've created a comprehensive dependency diagram for the src folder structure. The diagram shows:

**Key Dependencies:**
- **Root level** (index.ts) imports from `cli`, `utils`, and `types`
- **CLI folder** imports from `types` 
- **Parser folder** imports from `utils` and `types`
- **Utils folder** imports from `types` (some files also import from other utils)
- **Types folder** has no dependencies - it only exports interfaces

The architecture follows a clean layered pattern where:
1. `types` is the foundation layer
2. `utils` builds on types
3. `parser` uses both utils and types
4. `cli` only needs types
5. The root orchestrates everything

The Mermaid diagram visually represents these relationships with arrows showing the direction of dependencies. This structure promotes good separation of concerns and maintainability.

# QUESTION 2
The diagram is not easy to read. Make sure that the background colors of the folders are different and that the text is readable. Use a consistent color scheme for the folders and ensure that the text is clear against the background.

# Response 2
I'll improve the Mermaid diagram with better colors and readability. Let me update the diagram with a more visually appealing and readable color scheme.

Perfect! I've enhanced the Mermaid diagram with much better visual styling:

## Improvements Made:

1. **Distinct Colors**: Each folder now has its own unique, vibrant color:
   - **Root** (src): Blue (#2196F3) - Main entry point
   - **CLI**: Green (#4CAF50) - Command line interface
   - **Parser**: Orange (#FF9800) - Core parsing logic
   - **Types**: Purple (#9C27B0) - Type definitions
   - **Utils**: Red (#F44336) - Utility functions

2. **Better Contrast**: 
   - White text (`color:#fff`) on all colored backgrounds for maximum readability
   - Bold font weight for better visibility
   - Darker stroke colors for better definition

3. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Root folder has a thicker border (3px) to emphasize its importance
   - Other folders have 2px borders for consistency
   - Added folder icons (üìÅ) to make the diagram more visually appealing

4. **Professional Styling**:
   - Used Material Design color palette for consistency
   - Each folder type has its own class definition for better organization
   - Colors are semantically meaningful (green for CLI, orange for parsing, etc.)

The diagram is now much more readable and visually appealing while maintaining the same dependency structure information!
