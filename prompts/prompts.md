# QUESTION 1
You are implementing a COBOL parser that can handle PERFORM statements. The requirements are specified in the README.md file.
You have created an implementation plan divided in several phases and you have already completed the first three phases.
Now you must implement the phase 5 of the plan. You can find the phase 5 requirements in the file `plans/phase-5-basic-ast-construction-and-json-output.md`.

Now I can see the issue. The problem is that the paragraph detection logic is not properly working. Looking at the test output, I can see that the parser is including all lines in one paragraph instead of splitting them properly. Let me run a test to see what's happening: I can see the issue now. Looking at the output, I can see that the line processing is splitting "SUB-PARA" into "SUB-" (areaA) and "PARA." (areaB), resulting in the content being "SUB- PARA." instead of "SUB-PARA.". This means the paragraph detection regex won't match correctly.

Let me examine the line processor to understand how it's handling fixed format: I found the issue! The line processor is incorrectly handling the boundary between Area A and Area B. When processing "SUB-PARA.", the "-" is being treated as ending with punctuation, so it adds a space between "SUB-" and "PARA.", resulting in "SUB- PARA." instead of "SUB-PARA.".

Let me fix this by modifying the line processor to handle paragraph/section names correctly: 
```


Made changes.

Now let's run the tests again to see if this fixes the paragraph parsing issue: Excellent! All tests are now passing. Let me run the full test suite to make sure I haven't broken anything: Perfect! All tests are passing. The test suite shows 8 test suites with 138 tests all passing, which indicates that the AST Builder implementation is working correctly and hasn't broken any existing functionality.

Now let me test the CLI integration to make sure everything works end-to-end: Great! Now let me test the parser with one of the real COBOL files: Excellent! The AST Builder is working perfectly! Let me check the generated AST file to see a sample of the output: Perfect! The AST is being generated correctly with all the required information:

1. **Program structure**: The root program node with the extracted program name "EX-010"
2. **Hierarchical structure**: PROCEDURE DIVISION with paragraphs (no sections in this file)
3. **Source line information**: Each paragraph contains its source lines with full metadata
4. **PERFORM analysis**: The PERFORM statements are being detected and analyzed
5. **JSON output**: Clean, well-formatted JSON with metadata

Let me create the completion document for Phase 5: 

Made changes.

Summarized conversation historyBased on the conversation summary, Phase 5 has been completed successfully. Let me check the current state and see what's next in the project plan. Perfect! I can see that Phase 5 has been completed successfully, and we're ready to move on to Phase 6: COPY Statement Detection and Resolution. Let me check if there are any remaining tasks or if we should start Phase 6.
